/// This module manages issuing capabilities for world objects for access control.
///
/// The module defines three levels of capabilities:
/// - `GovernorCap`: Top-level capability (defined in world module)
/// - `AdminACL`: Shared object with a table of authorized sponsor addresses
/// - `OwnerCap`: Object-level capability that can be created by authorized sponsors
///
/// This hierarchy allows for delegation of permissions:
/// - Governor can add/remove sponsors in AdminACL
/// - Authorized sponsors can create/transfer/delete OwnerCaps
/// Future: Capability registry to support multi party access/shared control. (eg: A capability for corporation/tribe with multiple members)
/// Capabilities based on different roles/permission in a corporation/tribe.
